"""
setup.py is a build script for Python projects. It's used to define how a Python package should be built, 
distributed, and installed. When you're creating a Python library or application that others can install using pip, 
you typically include a setup.py file at the root of your project.

ðŸ“¦ Purpose of setup.py
It tells Python how to:

Package your project

Define metadata (name, version, author, etc.)

List dependencies

Specify which files to include

Provide entry points (like console scripts)
